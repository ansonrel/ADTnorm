\title{Plot ADT marker expression density profile with identified peak and valley locations}
\usage{
plot_adt_density_with_peak_valley(
  cell_x_adt,
  cell_x_feature,
  adt_marker_select = NULL,
  peak_landmark_list,
  valley_landmark_list,
  brewer_palettes = "Set1",
  parameter_list = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{cell_x_adt}{Matrix of ADT raw counts in cells (rows) by ADT markers (columns) format.}

\item{cell_x_feature}{Matrix of cells (rows) by cell features (columns) such as cell type, sample, and batch-related information.}

\item{adt_marker_select}{The target ADT marker(s) that the denstiy plot is about. Leave it NULL will generate figures for all the ADT markers available in cell_x_adt.}

\item{peak_landmark_list}{Matrix of peak landmark locations with rows being samples and columns being the peaks.}

\item{valley_landmark_list}{Matrix of valley landmark locations with rows being samples and columns being the valleys.}

\item{brewer_palettes}{Set the color scheme of the color brewer.}

\item{parameter_list}{Users can specify: "run_label" to give a name for this run; "bw" to adjust the bandwidth of the density plot.}
}
\description{
This function plots the ADT expression density profile with identified peak and valley locations. Each panel is an ADT marker, and each track is a sample. Color by batch
