## What is `ADTnorm`?

CITE-seq technology enables the direct measurement of protein expression, known as antibody-derived tags (ADT), in addition to RNA expression. The increase in the copy number of protein molecules leads to a more robust detection of protein features compared to RNA, providing a deep definition of cell types. However, due to added discrepancies of antibodies, such as the different types or concentrations of IgG antibodies, the batch effects of the ADT component of CITE-seq can dominate over biological variations, especially for the across-study integration. We present ADTnorm as a normalization and integration method designed explicitly for the ADT counts of CITE-seq data. Benchmarking with existing scaling and normalization methods, ADTnorm achieves a fast and accurate matching of the negative and positive peaks of the ADT counts across samples, efficiently removing technical variations across batches. Further quantitative evaluations confirm that ADTnorm achieves the best cell-type separation while maintaining the minimal batch effect. Therefore, ADTnorm facilitates the scalable ADT count integration of massive public CITE-seq datasets with distinguished experimental designs, which are essential for creating a corpus of well-annotated single-cell data with deep and standardized annotations.

## Installation

``` R
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("yezhengSTAT/ADTnorm", build_vignettes = FALSE)
```

### Using Docker

There are many dependencies in `ADTnorm`, so it takes a long time to install them all. Instead, you can use the Docker image of `ADTnorm`.

``` sh
docker pull ghcr.io/yezhengstat/adtnorm:latest
docker run \
  -it \
  --user rstudio \
  --volume <yourDataDirectory>:/home/rstudio/data \
  yezhengstat/adtnorm:latest \
  R
```

Replace `<yourDataDirectory>` with the local directory path (absolute path) where you have the input data and would like to store the output files. For more information on using docker containers, please read [this documentation](https://github.com/Bioconductor/bioconductor_docker/blob/master/README.md#using-the-containers) by Bioconductor.


## Input Data

## Usage


**For more detailed and typical parameter tuning examples, please visit [tutorial website](https://yezhengstat.github.io/ADTnorm/articles/ADTnorm-tutorial.html). We will illustrate using the demo data.**


### Option 1. Treating one study as a sample and a batch, normalize across studies.
```R
library(ADTnorm)
save_outpath <- "/path/to/output/location"
run_name <- "ADTnorm_demoRun"
data(cell_x_adt)
data(cell_x_feature) 

cell_x_feature$sample = factor(cell_x_feature$study_name) ## consider each study as one sample
cell_x_feature$batch = factor(cell_x_feature$study_name) ## consider each study as a batch

cell_x_adt_norm <- ADTnorm(
  cell_x_adt = cell_x_adt, 
  cell_x_feature = cell_x_feature,
  save_outpath = save_outpath, 
  study_name = run_name, 
  marker_to_process = c("CD3", "CD4", "CD8", "CD45RA"), 
  trimodal_marker = c("CD4", "CD45RA"), 
  positive_peak = list(ADT = "CD3", sample = "buus_2021_T"),
  save_intermediate_fig = TRUE
)
```

### Option 2. Treating one study as one batch, normalize across samples.
``` R
library(ADTnorm)
save_outpath <- "/path/to/output/location"
run_name <- "ADTnorm_demoRun"
data(cell_x_adt)
data(cell_x_feature) 

cell_x_feature$batch = factor(cell_x_feature$study_name) ## consider each study as a batch

cell_x_adt_norm <- ADTnorm(
  cell_x_adt = cell_x_adt, 
  cell_x_feature = cell_x_feature,
  save_outpath = save_outpath, 
  study_name = run_name, 
  marker_to_process = c("CD3", "CD4", "CD8", "CD45RA"), 
  trimodal_marker = c("CD4", "CD45RA"), 
  positive_peak = list(ADT = "CD3", sample = "buus_2021_T"),
  save_intermediate_fig = TRUE
)
```


Basic parameters introduction. The full parameter explanation for the ```ADTnorm``` function can be found at [Reference - ADTnorm](https://yezhengstat.github.io/ADTnorm/reference/ADTnorm.html). 

```
cell_x_adt:         Matrix of ADT raw counts in cells (rows) by ADT markers (columns) format.

cell_x_feature:     Matrix of cells (rows) by cell features (columns) such as cell type, sample, and batch-related information.

save_outpath:       The path to save the results.

study_name:         Name of this run.

marker_to_process:  Markers to normalize. Leave empty to process all the ADT markers in cell_x_adt matrix.

bimodal_marker:     Specify ADT markers that are likely to have two peaks based on researchers' prior knowledge or preliminary observation of the particular data to be processed. Leaving it as default, ADTnorm will try to find the bimodal peak in all markers that are not listed in `trimodal_marker.`

trimodal_marker:    Index of the ADT markers that tend to have three peaks based on researchers' prior knowledge (e.g., CD4) or preliminary observation of the particular data to be processed.

positive_peak:      A list variable containing a vector of ADT marker(s) and a corresponding vector of sample name(s) in matching order to specify that the uni-peak detected should be aligned to positive peaks. For example, for samples that only contain T cells the only CD3 peak should be aligned to the positive peaks of other samples.

save_intermediate_fig:  Save the density plot figure for checking the peak and valley location detection.
```

## Results

```ADTnorm``` function will generate a matrix of rows of the same number as input ```cell_x_adt``` row number and columns are ADT markers specificed in ```marker_to_process```. The value in the matrix is normalized value by ADTnorm.  In the `save_outpath` specified by the users, there will be two subfolders, `figures` and `RDS`, containing the intermediate object and density plot of detected peak and valley landmarks before and after ADTnorm. Those figures can be used to check if further parameter tuning is needed for certain ADT markers.

### Option 3. Manual Adjustment of Landmark Locations by R Shiny

By setting ```customized_landmark``` to be TRUE, ADTnorm will trigger the interactive landmark tuning function and pop out an R Shiny application for user's manual setting of the peaks and valleys location. We recommend using this function after initial rounds of ADTnorm normalization with a few parameters tuning attempt. It is better to narrow down a few ADT markers that do need manual tuning and provide the list to marker_to_process as the interactive function will pop out for every marker being processed. The procedure to adjust the landmarks (peaks and valleys) are indicated below. 

<img src="../man/figures/ShinyR.png" alt="ShinyR" width="1000px">

If zigzag discrete negative peaks are observed, user can first adjust the "Density plot bandwidth" at the top of right panel to smooth out the discrete negative peaks before setting the landmarks.
